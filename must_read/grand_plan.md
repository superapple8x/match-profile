## 1. Overview
This document describes the comprehensive strategy to build a scalable and robust Profile Matching Application. The application targets industries such as healthcare, education, human resources, social services, government, and research. Its primary function is to manage profile data, perform precise matching using weighted algorithms, and provide advanced analytics for data-driven decision-making.

## 2. Goals and Objectives
- Develop a secure, maintainable system for profile data management and analysis.
- Implement a reliable matching engine using configurable criteria and weighted scoring.
- Deliver a user-friendly interface for search configuration, result visualization, and saved searches.
- Integrate advanced statistical analysis to provide actionable insights.
- Ensure scalability, performance, and rigorous security across the application.

## 3. Architecture & Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
- **Matching Engine:** Custom Node.js module to handle weighted scoring and multiple matching algorithms.
- **API:** RESTful endpoints for data manipulation and matching operations.
- **Development Tools:** ESLint, Jest for testing, and Docker for containerization.

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React.js using functional components and hooks.
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js for building interactive dashboards.
- **UI/UX:** Responsive design using Material-UI or Bootstrap for consistency.
