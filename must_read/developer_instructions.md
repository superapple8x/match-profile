# Developer Instructions for Profile Matching Project

## 1. Overview
This file provides guidelines for future developers working on the Profile Matching Application. It outlines what tasks to perform (DOs) and what actions to avoid (DON'Ts).

## 2. Activity Log Requirements
- Every change must be documented in an activity log.
- The activity log must include the following details:
  - The timestamp when the work was performed (date and time).
  - A detailed description of the activity performed.
  - A list of files created or modified.
  - Specific parts or sections of files that were changed.
  - The reason behind each modification.
- Maintain the activity log in commit messages and, if applicable, in a centralized log file (e.g., activity_log.txt).

## 3. Best Practices (DOs)
- Follow the project's established guidelines as outlined in "grand_plan.md" and "implementation_steps.md".
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Ensure comprehensive testing (unit tests, integration tests) accompanies every change.
- Log every modification with detailed commit messages and an activity log.
- Update documentation regularly when changes are made.
- Participate in code reviews and collaborate effectively.

## 4. Prohibited Actions (DON'Ts)
- Do not commit incomplete or untested code.
- Do not mix unrelated changes in a single commit.
- Avoid bypassing code reviews or neglecting proper documentation.
- Never remove or alter the activity log or commit history without proper authorization.

## 5. Communication and Change Management
- Discuss major changes with senior developers or the team before implementation.
- Use designated communication channels for discussing project modifications.
- Update architectural documents (grand_plan.md and implementation_steps.md) if core changes are made.

## 6. Additional Guidelines
- Backup data and configuration files before executing major changes.
- Test all changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- Follow security best practices and ensure proper access control.
- Adhere to CI/CD protocols and version control best practices.

## 7. Conclusion
Adhering to these instructions will ensure that the project remains maintainable, secure, and scalable. Thorough documentation and a consistent activity log are critical for future development and troubleshooting.
