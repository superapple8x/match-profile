# Step 4: Frontend Development Detailed Planning

## Overview
With the successful completion of Backend Development (Step 3), we now focus on Frontend Development to deliver a responsive, user-friendly interface that integrates seamlessly with our matching engine.

## Objectives and Goals
- Develop a responsive, single-page application using React.js.
- Build key UI components for file import, dataset editing, search configuration, result display, and saved searches.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.
- Integrate backend APIs for data operations and error handling.
- Establish a clear testing strategy using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
- **UI Libraries:** Material-UI or Bootstrap (to be decided)
- **State Management:** React Hooks / Context API
- **Data Visualization (Phase 2):** Chart.js
- **Testing:** React Testing Library, Jest

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Project Initialization and Setup
- Create a new React project (using Create React App or a custom setup).
- Establish the frontend folder structure under `src/frontend` (if not already present).
- Configure routing and basic layout components.

### 2. Component Development
- **File Import & Dataset Editor:**
  - Design an interface for uploading CSV, XLS, and XLSX files.
  - Implement client-side file parsing and validation.
- **Search Configuration Panel:**
  - Create components to select attributes, adjust weights, and set search parameters.
- **Results Dashboard:**
  - Build a detailed results display to show match percentages and breakdowns.
- **Saved Searches Management:**
  - Develop functionality for users to save and manage their search configurations.

### 3. API Integration
- Integrate backend RESTful endpoints for file import, search execution, and data retrieval.
- Implement error handling and loading states for API calls.

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Write unit tests for each component using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Set up integration tests to cover API interactions.
- Ensure cross-browser and mobile responsiveness through manual/automated testing.

### 5. Timeline and Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Initial project setup and basic layout (Days 1-2).
- **Milestone 2:** Development of File Import and Search Configuration components (Days 3-5).
- **Milestone 3:** Integration of API and Results Dashboard (Days 6-8).
- **Milestone 4:** Testing, responsiveness, and UI refinements (Days 9-10).
- **Phase 2 (Advanced Features):** Data visualization and automated reporting (post initial release).

### 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- **Backend API Integration Risk:** Ensure robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Regular testing and use of polyfills where necessary.
- **Component Scalability:** Design modular components for future enhancements.

### 7. Next Steps
- Initiate project setup and component scaffolding.
- Schedule a review meeting with the development team to align on design and implementation details.

## Conclusion
This detailed frontend development plan serves as a roadmap for completing Step 4. By following these steps, the project will achieve a robust, responsive, and integrated user interface, laying the foundation for subsequent advanced features.
