# Phase 3: Integration and Testing

This document outlines the detailed plan for integration and testing of the Profile Matching Application.

## 3.1 Integration

### 3.1.1 Component Integration

The new components will be integrated into the existing application structure:

### 3.1.2 Data Flow

The data flow between components will be standardized:

1.  User inputs search criteria via SearchBar or SearchBuilder
2.  Search criteria are passed to the parent component (SearchConfig)
3.  SearchConfig passes the criteria to the backend for processing
4.  Results are returned and passed to ResultsDashboard
5.  ResultsDashboard displays the results and allows for interaction

### 3.1.3 Phased Rollout

The UI enhancements will be rolled out in phases to minimize disruption:

1.  First, implement the core SearchBar component without auto-suggestions
2.  Add the Weight Adjustment Modal
3.  Enhance the Results Display
4.  Add auto-suggestions to the SearchBar
5.  Refine the visual design and animations

This phased approach allows for testing and validation at each step, ensuring a smooth transition to the enhanced UI.

## 3.2 Testing

### 3.2.1 Component Testing

Each new component will be tested individually:

1.  **SearchBar Tests**:
    *   Test input parsing for various formats
    *   Test suggestion generation
    *   Test criteria selection and removal

2.  **Weight Adjustment Modal Tests**:
    *   Test weight adjustment functionality
    *   Test apply and cancel actions

3.  **Results Display Tests**:
    *   Test with various data structures
    *   Test visualization components

### 3.2.2 Integration Testing

After individual component testing, integration tests will verify:

1.  Data flow between components
2.  State management across the application
3.  Error handling and edge cases

### 3.2.3 User Experience Testing

Finally, user experience testing will evaluate:

1.  Intuitiveness of the search interface
2.  Clarity of results display
3.  Overall usability and satisfaction

## Detailed Steps:

1.  Integrate all components into a cohesive interface.
2.  Ensure proper data flow between components.
3.  Standardize data structures across components.
4.  Test sorting functionality with various data types.
5.  Test search interface with different input patterns.
6.  Test results display with different search criteria.
7.  Perform cross-browser and responsive design testing.

## Success Criteria:

1.  All components are seamlessly integrated into the application.
2.  Data flows correctly between components.
3.  The application is functioning as expected.
4.  The UI is intuitive and user-friendly.
