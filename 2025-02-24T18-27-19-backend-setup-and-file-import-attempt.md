# Activity Log: Backend Setup and File Import Attempt

**Timestamp:** 2025-02-24T18:27:19+07:00 (Asia/Jakarta)

**Developer:** Roo

**Completed Work Items:**

-   Initialized backend with Node.js and Express.
-   Created RESTful endpoints for file import and export in `src/backend/routes/fileOperations.js`.
-   Integrated file parsing libraries (multer, papaparse, xlsx).
-   Mounted file operation routes in `src/backend/index.js`.
-   Attempted troubleshooting of file import functionality.

**Associated Files/Changes:**

-   `src/backend/index.js` (modified)
-   `src/backend/routes/fileOperations.js` (created)
-   `test.csv` (created for testing)

**Technical Validation Steps Performed:**

-   Used `curl` to send POST requests to the `/api/files/import` endpoint.
-   Verified server startup and response to basic GET requests.
-   Checked middleware order in `src/backend/index.js`.
-   Reinstalled `multer` dependency.
-   Added logging to `fileFilter` and route handler to inspect MIME type and `req.file`/`req.files`.
-   Restarted the server multiple times to ensure changes were reflected.
-   Tried `upload.single('file')`, `upload.array('file', 1)`, and `upload.any()` in `multer` configuration.

**Peer Review Status:**

- Not applicable (solo development)

**Notes:**

- File import functionality is currently NOT working. The server consistently returns "No file uploaded" despite multiple debugging attempts. The `req.file` and `req.files` objects are undefined within the route handler. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause.
