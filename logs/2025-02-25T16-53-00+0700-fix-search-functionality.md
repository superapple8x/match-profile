**Completed work items:**

*   Fixed the search functionality issue where the app was not returning results for valid search criteria.

**Files modified:**

*   `src/frontend/src/App.js`
    *   Reason: Modified the `handleSearch` function to properly transform the search criteria into a `baseProfile` object and include the appropriate `matchingRules` in the API request. This ensures that the backend receives the search criteria in the expected format.
*   `src/backend/matchingEngine.js`
    *   Reason: Enhanced the `exactMatch` and `partialTextMatch` functions to normalize strings using `normalize('NFC').trim().toLowerCase()` to handle potential character encoding issues and ensure accurate comparisons.
    *   Reason: Added detailed logging in the `calculateMatchScore` function to trace the matching process and aid in debugging.

**Technical validation steps performed:**

1.  Verified that the search criteria are correctly passed from the frontend to the backend.
2.  Verified that the backend is correctly processing the search criteria and returning the correct results.
3.  Tested the search functionality with different data sets and search criteria to identify any patterns or edge cases.
4.  Confirmed that the search with the criteria "Age:27+Gender:Male+Location:Pakistan" now returns the expected results.

**Peer review status:**

*   Not applicable (no peer review performed)
