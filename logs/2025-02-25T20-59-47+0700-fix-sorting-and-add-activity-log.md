### Issue Resolved:
Fixed the sorting functionality in ResultsTable.js that was not properly ordering match percentages.

### Steps Taken:
1. Identified duplicate key warnings in console indicating non-unique row identifiers
2. Modified key generation to use a combination of index and match percentage
3. Added debug logging to track sorting values and types
4. Ensured proper numeric comparison by converting percentage strings
5. Added null/undefined value handling in sort comparison

### Technical Details:
- Added uniqueKey field combining index and match percentage
- Modified getNestedValue to handle percentage string conversion
- Added Number() conversion for reliable numeric comparison
- Implemented proper null/undefined handling in sort logic

### Next Steps for Development:
1. Implement comprehensive unit tests for sorting functionality
2. Add error handling for invalid match percentage values
3. Consider adding multi-column sorting capability
4. Optimize sorting performance for large datasets
5. Add visual indicators for current sort state

### Testing Results:
- Sorting now correctly orders results from highest to lowest match percentage
- Toggling sort direction properly reverses the order
- No duplicate key warnings in console
- All edge cases (null/undefined values) handled appropriately

### Additional Notes:
The fix required careful analysis of the data flow and React's rendering behavior. The solution maintains the existing functionality while adding robustness and proper error handling.
