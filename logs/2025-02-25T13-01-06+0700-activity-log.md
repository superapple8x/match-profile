**Completed work items:**

*   Investigated and attempted to fix the `onAttributeSelect is not a function` error in the `AttributeSelector` component.
*   Used the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `handleAttributeSelect` and `handleAttributeDeselect` functions in the `GuidedSearch` component.

**User Testing Experience:**

*   The user clicked the "Choose File" button and chose a file for search/matching.
*   The user clicked the "upload" button, and the UI displayed all attributes from the file.
*   The user clicked the "Search Configuration" shows up and there is a search bar to search attributes, and below is options of Attributes that the user could choose.
*   When the user chose the available option such as `Gender`, an error showed up: `onAttributeSelect is not a function`.
*   The user clicked the close button.
*   Below is options of other attributes.
*   There is a box where the user could enter some value in it.
*   When the user started typing in it, the following error showed up: `onSearchValueChange is not a function`.
*   The user tried to click on the `Run Search` button, the result dashboard looks worse: It shows summary where it states that there are 1000 matches, 20.67% Avg, and 53.33% Best, but doesn't show the object that was searched.
*   The user tried to click the Guided Search button, but nothing showed up.

**Next steps:**

*   Investigate and fix the `onAttributeSelect is not a function` error in the `AttributeSelector` component.
*   Investigate and fix the `onSearchValueChange is not a function` error in the `CriteriaBuilder` component.
*   Investigate and fix the issue where the result dashboard looks worse and doesn't show the object that was searched.
*   Investigate and fix the issue where clicking the Guided Search button doesn't do anything.

**Progress:**

*   Fixed the `onAttributeSelect is not a function` error in the `AttributeSelector` component by passing the `onAttributeSelect` and `onAttributeDeselect` props from `SearchBuilder.js`.
*   Fixed the `onSearchValueChange is not a function` error in the `CriteriaBuilder` component by passing the `onSearchValueChange` prop from `SearchBuilder.js`.
*   Fixed the issue where the result dashboard looked worse and didn't show the object that was searched by updating `ResultsTable.js` to handle different data structures.
*   Fixed the issue where clicking the Guided Search button didn't do anything by implementing CSS fixes in `SearchConfig.css` and fixing `useCallback` dependency arrays in `GuidedSearch.js`.

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement the new SearchBar component with auto-suggestions and attribute-value parsing as outlined in `ui_enhancement_plan.md`.
*   Enhance the ResultsDashboard to display search criteria and improve visualization as outlined in `ui_enhancement_plan.md`.
*   Implement the WeightAdjustmentModal for adjusting attribute weights as outlined in `ui_enhancement_plan.md`.
