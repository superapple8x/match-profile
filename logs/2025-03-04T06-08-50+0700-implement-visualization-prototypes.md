**Completed Work Items:**

*   Implemented visualization prototypes in the `ResultsDashboard` component.
*   Created two branches, `feature/viz-prototype-chartjs` and `feature/viz-prototype-d3`.
*   Added Chart.js and D3.js libraries to the project.
*   Created `FrequencyHeatmap.js` and `TrendLines.js` components in `src/frontend/src/components/VisualizationPrototypes/ChartJS`.
*   Created `NetworkGraph.js` and `TimeSeries.js` components in `src/frontend/src/components/VisualizationPrototypes/D3`.
*   Modified `ResultsDashboard.js` to include the visualization prototypes.
*   Modified `ResultsDashboard.css` to style the visualization prototypes.

**Associated Files/Changes:**

*   Created:
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/VisualizationPrototypes/ChartJS/FrequencyHeatmap.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/VisualizationPrototypes/ChartJS/TrendLines.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/VisualizationPrototypes/D3/NetworkGraph.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/VisualizationPrototypes/D3/TimeSeries.js`
*   Modified:
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/ResultsDashboard.js` - Added imports and JSX for the visualization prototypes.
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/ResultsDashboard.css` - Added styling for the visualization prototypes.
    *   `src/frontend/package.json` - Added Chart.js and D3.js dependencies.

**Technical Validation Steps Performed:**

*   Verified that the visualization prototypes are displayed correctly in the `ResultsDashboard` component.
*   Verified that the visualization prototypes are styled correctly.
*   Verified that the Chart.js and D3.js libraries are installed correctly.

**Reason Behind Edit or Creation:**

*   The visualization prototypes were created to provide a visual representation of the search results.
*   The `ResultsDashboard.js` and `ResultsDashboard.css` files were modified to include the visualization prototypes.
*   The `package.json` file was modified to include the Chart.js and D3.js dependencies.

**Peer Review Status:**

*   Not applicable

**Next Steps:**

1.  Implement data binding for the visualization prototypes to display real data.
2.  Implement user interactions for the visualization prototypes.
3.  Implement unit tests for the visualization prototypes.
