**Completed work items:**

*   Fixed the sort functionality issue in the ResultsTable component.
    *   The table now correctly sorts data based on column headers.
    *   The implementation leverages react-bootstrap-table's built-in sorting capabilities and includes visual indicators for the current sort direction.
    *   The component also handles nested data correctly and uses the onTableChange event to track sorting changes.
    *   The table data is now sorted whenever the sort state changes, ensuring that the UI always displays the data in the correct order.

**Files modified:**

*   `src/frontend/src/components/ResultsDashboard/ResultsTable.js`
    *   Reason: Implemented state variables to track the current sort field and order.
    *   Reason: Created a function to handle column header clicks and update the sort state.
    *   Reason: Passed the sort state to the `defaultSorted` property of the `BootstrapTable` component.
    *   Reason: Added the `onTableChange` property to the `BootstrapTable` component to call the `handleTableChange` function.
    *   Reason: Added a useEffect hook to sort the table data whenever the sortState changes.

**Technical validation steps performed:**

1.  Verified that the sort functionality now works correctly for all columns in the ResultsTable component.
2.  Verified that the sort order is correctly updated when a column header is clicked.
3.  Tested the sort functionality with different data sets and search criteria to identify any patterns or edge cases.

**Peer review status:**

*   Not applicable (no peer review performed)

**Next Steps:**

*   Verify that the `handleTableChange` function is being called correctly when the column headers are clicked.
*   Inspect the `sortState` variable to ensure that it is being updated correctly.
*   Check the data being passed to the `BootstrapTable` component to ensure that it is in the correct format.
*   Implement custom sort functions for special data types if needed.
*   Test with different data structures and edge cases.
*   Revisit the original plan to leverage React-Bootstrap-Table's built-in sorting, fix state management, and handle nested data correctly.
