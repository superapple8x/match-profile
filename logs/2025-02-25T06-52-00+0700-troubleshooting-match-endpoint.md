# Activity Log: Troubleshooting /api/files/match Endpoint

**Timestamp:** 2025-02-25T06:52:00+07:00 (Asia/Jakarta)

**Developer:** Roo

**Completed Work Items:**

*   Attempted to troubleshoot the `/api/files/match` endpoint, which is returning a 404 Not Found error and causing a JSON parsing error on the frontend.

**Associated Files/Changes:**

*   `src/frontend/src/App.js` (modified)
*   `src/backend/routes/fileOperations.js` (modified)

**Technical Validation Steps Performed:**

*   Verified that the backend routes are correctly defined and mounted in `src/backend/index.js`.
*   Restarted the backend server multiple times to ensure the latest code is running.
*   Corrected the endpoint URLs in the frontend code (`src/frontend/src/App.js` and `src/frontend/src/components/FileImport.js`).
*   Added console logs to the `/match` endpoint in `src/backend/routes/fileOperations.js` to inspect the request body and the response data.
*   Attempted to fix TypeScript errors in the backend code (`src/backend/routes/fileOperations.js`) by removing duplicate code and extra curly braces.

**Peer Review Status:**

*   Not applicable (solo development)

**Notes:**

*   The `/api/files/match` endpoint is still returning a 404 Not Found error, and the frontend is throwing a `SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data`. This indicates that the backend is not handling the request correctly or is not sending a valid JSON response. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause. The console logs added to the backend have not shown up in the server.log, which suggests the request is not reaching the endpoint.
