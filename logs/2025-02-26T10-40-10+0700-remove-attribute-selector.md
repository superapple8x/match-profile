## Completed Work Items:

- Removed the deprecated `AttributeSelector` component and its associated logic from `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBuilder.js`. This included removing the component import, related state variables and functions, and the JSX element.

## Associated Files/Changes:

- Modified: `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBuilder.js`

## Technical Validation:

- Reviewed the code in `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBuilder.js` to identify the `AttributeSelector` component and its related code.
- Confirmed the removal of the component and its associated logic by examining the updated code.
- Verified that the changes match the user's request to remove the "Search Configuration" component with the "Search Attributes" search bar.

## Files Edited:

- `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBuilder.js`: Removed the `AttributeSelector` component, its associated state variables (`selectedAttributes`), related functions (`handleAttributeSelect`, `handleAttributeDeselect`), and the JSX responsible for rendering the component and its associated `CriteriaBuilder` instances. Also removed the `<h3>Search Configuration</h3>` heading.
