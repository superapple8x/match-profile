### Task Completed:
Implemented state management for the enhanced SearchBar component, as described in section 2.1.2 of `planning_ahead/phase2_ui_enhancement_implementation.md`.

### Steps Taken:

1.  **Added State Variables:** Implemented `useState` hooks for:
    *   `inputValue`: Stores the current text input value.
    *   `currentAttribute`: Stores the currently typed attribute.
    *   `currentValue`: Stores the currently typed value.
    *   `suggestions`: Stores the list of suggestions.
    *   `selectedCriteria`: Stores the list of selected criteria.
    *   `showWeightAdjuster`: Controls the visibility of the `WeightAdjustmentModal`.
    *   `attributeValues`: Stores a map of attributes to their possible values.
    *   `inputRef`: Added to manage input focus.

2.  **Implemented Input Handling:**
    *   Created `handleInputChange` to update `inputValue` and parse the input into `currentAttribute` and `currentValue`.
    *   Split `handleInputChange` into `handleAttributeInput` and `handleValueInput` for better code organization.
    *   `handleAttributeInput`: Updates `currentAttribute` and generates attribute suggestions.
    *   `handleValueInput`: Updates `currentAttribute` and `currentValue`, and generates value suggestions based on the current attribute.

3.  **Implemented Suggestion Selection:**
    *   Updated `handleSuggestionSelect` to handle both attribute and value suggestions.
    *   Clears input and suggestions after selecting a suggestion.
    *   Adds selected criteria to the `selectedCriteria` array.

4.  **Implemented Keydown Handling:**
    *   Updated `handleKeyDown` to handle Enter and Space keys.
    *   Pressing Enter selects the first suggestion if available, or adds the current input as a criterion if no suggestions are present.
    *   Pressing Space adds the current input as a criterion.

5. **Added Prop Type Validation:**
    * Added `PropTypes` to the component and imported it from the `prop-types` package.
    * Validated that `importedData` is an array of objects and `onSearch` is a function.

6. **Fix PropTypes Error:**
    * Added import for `PropTypes` to resolve the "PropTypes is not defined" error.

### Files Edited:

*   `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBar.js`: Implemented state management, input handling, suggestion selection, keydown handling, and prop type validation.

### Technical Validation:

1.  **Manual Testing:** Manually tested the SearchBar component by typing various inputs, selecting suggestions, adding criteria, and verifying that the state updates correctly.
2.  **Console Logging:** Used `console.log` to inspect the values of state variables during development and ensure they were updating as expected.
3.  **React DevTools:** Used React DevTools to inspect the component's state and props and verify that they matched the expected values.
4. **Linter:** Addressed linter errors.
