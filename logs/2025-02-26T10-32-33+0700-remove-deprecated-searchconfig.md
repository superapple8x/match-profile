**Timestamp:** 2025-02-26T10:32:33+07:00

**Completed Work Items:**

- Removed the deprecated SearchConfig component and related CSS file.
- Updated the `searchReducer.js` to remove legacy state management related to the SearchConfig component.
- Resolved build errors that arose after removing the SearchConfig component, including duplicate React imports and missing CSS import in `SearchBuilder.js`.

**Associated Files/Changes:**

- **Deleted:**
    - `src/frontend/src/components/SearchConfig.js`
    - `src/frontend/src/components/SearchConfig.css`
- **Modified:**
    - `src/frontend/src/store/searchReducer.js`
        - Reason: Removed legacy state variables (`attributeSelections`) and related reducer logic as they are no longer used with the removal of the SearchConfig component.
    - `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBuilder.js`
        - Reason: Removed import statement for `SearchConfig.css` as it's no longer needed. Removed duplicate `React` import statements that were causing build errors.

**Technical Validation Steps Performed:**

- Codebase review to confirm the removal of all references to the SearchConfig component.
- Build process verification to ensure no compilation errors after the component removal and code modifications.

**Peer Review Status:**
