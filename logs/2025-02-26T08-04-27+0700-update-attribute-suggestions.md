**Timestamp:** 2025-02-26T08:04:27+07:00

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `handleAttributeInput` function in `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBar.js`
- Updated suggestion filtering logic to use `startsWith()` instead of `includes()`
- Reorganized validation flow to show suggestions first, then validate syntax
- Improved error handling consistency

**Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBar.js`

**Purpose/Impact:**
- Provides more intuitive partial matching for attribute suggestions
- Shows suggestions immediately while typing
- Maintains better error handling flow
- Improves user experience when building search queries

**Notes:**
- Suggestions now appear for partial matches (e.g. "Loc" shows "Location")
- Syntax validation only occurs when no matches are found
- Error messages remain consistent with existing patterns
