**Timestamp:** 2025-02-25T15:54:00+07:00

**Completed work items:**

*   Attempted to fix the search functionality issue where the app was returning no results.
*   Modified the `/import` route in `src/backend/routes/fileOperations.js` to properly decode the file buffer as UTF-8, ensuring that special characters are handled correctly.
*   Started the backend and frontend servers.
*   Modified the `/match` route in `src/backend/routes/fileOperations.js` to map the properties of the `compareProfiles` to match the `baseProfile`, preventing the `TypeError` in the `calculateMatchScore` function.
*   Modified the `calculateMatchScore` function in `src/backend/matchingEngine.js` to handle missing properties in the profile object.

**Current issue:**

*   The search functionality is still not working correctly. The search is returning no results, even though there should be matches based on the imported data.

**Next steps:**

*   Further investigate the search logic in the frontend and backend to identify the cause of the issue.
*   Verify that the search criteria are being correctly passed from the frontend to the backend.
*   Verify that the backend is correctly processing the search criteria and returning the correct results.
*   Test the search functionality with different data sets and search criteria to identify any patterns or edge cases.
