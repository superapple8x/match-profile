# Activity Log - Refactor SearchConfig Component

**Timestamp:** 2025-02-25T10:41:44+07:00

**Completed Work Items:**

*   Refactored the `SearchConfig` component into smaller, more manageable components.
    *   Created `AttributeSelector`, `CriteriaBuilder`, `WeightAdjuster`, and `MatchingRuleSelector` components.
    *   Moved the attribute selection logic to `AttributeSelector.js`.
    *   Moved the weight adjustment logic to `WeightAdjuster.js`.
    *   Moved the matching rule logic to `MatchingRuleSelector.js`.
    *   Updated the `SearchBuilder` component to use the new components.
    *   Updated the `App` component to use the `SearchBuilder` component.

**Associated Files/Changes:**

*   Created:
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/AttributeSelector.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/CriteriaBuilder.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/WeightAdjuster.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/MatchingRuleSelector.js`
*   Edited:
    *   `src/frontend/src/App.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/SearchBuilder.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/WeightAdjuster.js`
    *   `src/frontend/src/components/MatchingRuleSelector.js`

**Technical Validation Steps Performed:**

*   Ensured that the application still compiles and runs without errors.
*   Verified that the search configuration functionality still works as expected.
*   Checked that the frontend and backend are communicating correctly.

**Reason behind the edit or creation:**

*   The `SearchConfig` component was becoming too large and complex. Refactoring it into smaller components improves maintainability and readability.

**Peer Review Status:**

*   Not applicable.
