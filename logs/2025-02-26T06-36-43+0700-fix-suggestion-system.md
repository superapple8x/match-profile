# Activity Log: Fix Suggestion System

## Timestamp: 2025-02-26T06:36:43+0700

## Completed Work Items:
1. Implemented centralized state management using useReducer
2. Added validation middleware for attribute and value inputs
3. Updated state structure to include suggestions and currentAttribute
4. Modified SearchBar component to use reducer state
5. Fixed state initialization issues

## Current Issue:
The suggestion system that previously showed available values when entering an attribute (e.g., "Age:") is not functioning. The system should:
1. Show available attributes when typing before the colon
2. Show valid values for the selected attribute after the colon
3. Provide error feedback for invalid inputs

## Technical Validation Steps:
1. Verified state initialization in SearchBar component
2. Checked attributeValues population from importedData
3. Tested suggestion generation logic
4. Verified UI updates for suggestions

## Associated Files/Changes:
- src/frontend/src/components/SearchBar.js
- src/frontend/src/store/searchReducer.js
- src/frontend/src/utils/validation.js

## Next Steps:
1. Fix attributeValues population from importedData
2. Ensure currentAttribute is set correctly
3. Update suggestion generation logic
4. Test suggestion system functionality
