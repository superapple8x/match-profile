**Completed work items:**

*   Attempted to fix the sort functionality issue in the ResultsTable component.
    *   Chose to use react-bootstrap-table's built-in sorting.
    *   Removed the custom sorting logic.
    *   Ensured `remote.sort` is set to `true`.
    *   Added logging for debugging.

**Files modified:**

*   `src/frontend/src/components/ResultsDashboard/ResultsTable.js`

**Remaining issues:**

*   The sort functionality is still not working correctly.

**Next steps for front end development (assuming the sorting button is fixed):**

*   Phase 4: Integration and Testing
