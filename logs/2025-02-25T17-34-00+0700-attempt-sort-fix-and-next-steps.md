**Completed work items:**

*   Attempted to fix the sort functionality issue in the ResultsTable component.
    *   Chose to use react-bootstrap-table's built-in sorting.
    *   Removed the custom sorting logic.
    *   Ensured `remote.sort` is set to `true`.
    *   Added logging for debugging.

**Files modified:**

*   `src/frontend/src/components/ResultsDashboard/ResultsTable.js`

**Remaining issues:**

*   The sort functionality is still not working correctly.

**Next steps for front end development (assuming the sorting button is fixed):**

1.  Implement the new SearchBar component with auto-suggestions and attribute-value parsing.
2.  Enhance the ResultsDashboard to display search criteria and improve visualization.
3.  Implement the WeightAdjustmentModal for adjusting attribute weights.
